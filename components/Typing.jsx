          This is a speed typing game wrtitten in react. This game was made to test my skills writing clean code in React. Code was updated in Github using front end developer best practices. Steps were taken to ensure that the code was DRY.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was made early on in Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path course. This was also deployed using Netlify.
